## Hammer Time!

This week, I built a mallet to gift to my camp, conveniently named HAMMER TIME.

## Testing with a Poplar Dowel

This was my first time doing interlocking parts on the lathe, so I wanted to test everything before messing up my precious block of beautiful maple. I had a large poplar dowel sitting around so I figured I'd mill it a bit and practice drilling the two main holes I would need to attach the handle: the hole for the handle and the hole to insert the dowel into the handle.

### Here's where things start to get tricky.

*Using the lathe's manual turning, I measured out an arbitrary center. And then from that marked center I measured out plus and minus 60 degrees. These would be my dowel holes. (I chose 60 degrees instead of 90 degrees because I really want my dowel rod below center.)*

*Lathing plywood in this direction proved incredibly difficult. This was the most time consuming part of the entire project. Eventually, I got it just right!*

## Turning the Maple Mallet Head

*Beautiful piece of maple ordered from Woodcraft. Took a while to deliver so I really didn't want to mess this part up.*

*Roughing it was pretty scary.*

*Unfortunately, my drill bit wasn't long enough so I only drilled a hole on one side. This was simpler, and I think more aesthetically pleasing this way.*

*Using a V-block, I drill press a hole for the rod to fit.*

## Finishing Touches

*Because I had one clean side without a dowel hole, I decided to etch it.*

*And lastly, two layers of tung oil to finish it all off*
