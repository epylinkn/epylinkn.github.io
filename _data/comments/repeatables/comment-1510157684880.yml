message: "Nice work, love that you made round objects on the sander.  I want to see more of your jig and maybe a short video of it being used on the sander.\r\n\r\nGlad you used clamps and a vice on the drill press, it makes drilling those holes much more accurate.\r\n\r\nDoes the top part move smoothly on the dowels?"
