## Meditations

Mind blown... just from the first paragraph of readings. I never knew that Nabokov's Lolita might be considered a stolen plot.

Yet, also very liberating. As an emerging artist, there's so much pressure in finding our individual practice, on being original.

> Cryptomnesia - experiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration.

There's so much gray area. But at the same time, I think I've always known that none of my thoughts are purely original.

The burden of citation is too high. In some selfish way, I hate that the labor of doing so falls onto the artist. How can we shift some of that responsibility to the consumer--after all only some of them care about original source whereas most consumers don't. Even then, how far do you take it when attributing to an original source. Do I cite Bob Dylan if I sample from Bob Dylan? Or do I cite those artists that he sampled from? Does anyone really care unless money or fame is involved?
