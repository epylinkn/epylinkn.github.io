Concept
-------

I've been dwelling on this idea of a loaded prize wheel. Because there's something about hitting a jackpot on large wheel that really evokes joy. Joy is something I want to manipulate.

*I started on a shoddy mockup for my CNC skill builder.*

Materials
---------

I started on parts of this in other skill builder assignments. But for this build, I had to rethink material choices. First, I wanted to use MDF. I haven't worked with MDF much but know that it's good for consistency. And for the "loaded" part to work, I figure I'll need uniform weight and precise flatness!

*Big, heavy MDF. Need more gym time.*

*MDF isn't the friendlist material, so I upgraded my protective gear as well.*

Bearing upgrade. The initial lazy susan wasn't cutting it. So I upgraded to a bearing that can wall mount easily on some speed rail.

Prototype
---------

I made some quick cuts based on the previous design and just made sure everything comes together properly.

*The wheel! Not as big as I wanted, but the max size for the T-molding I bought.*

For the loaded aspect, I started thinking a lot about gears. [Gear Generator](http://geargenerator.com/#200,200,100,6,1,0,0,4,1,8,2,4,27,-90,0,0,16,4,4,27,-60,1,1,12,1,12,20,-60,2,0,60,5,12,20,0,0,0,2,-563)

Finishing
---------

MDF edging is a little ugly.

Structure
---------

I really want to wall mount this, so I spent a lot of time thinking about how to use speedrail to reinforce everything.*

Things I Learned
----------------

- MDF
  - finishing
  - flat!
  - dusty and bad for you
  - HEAVY

- gear generator
  - difficulty of getting mechanical advantage
- wall mounting - omg too heavy


Next Steps
----------
- finishing paint job
- LEDs
- lighter weight?
- gear testing
