In this post, I use the wood lathe for the first time and just explore different tools and materials.

Given how dangerous the wood lathe can be, I was mostly focused on safety and taking things slow.

## Materials

I wanted to experiment with different material thicknesses.

*Thin, oak dowel. And thick, poplar dowel.*

*TIL poplar is a softwood. So I got to experiment with different material hardness too!*

## Lathe-ing Oak

The oak is noticeably harder. I spent my time just trying out all the chisels (large and small) demoed in class.

*Not so much intended to be a handle, but I thought it was handle-like enough.*

*I separated it into two handles. Not quite the dimensions of the skill builder task, but perfect for a pizza cutter I want to attach to.*

## Lathe-ing Poplar

The poplar was soft and it turned much more comfortably. However, the final finish wasn't as smooth. (I didn't use sandpaper.)

*Plunging at angles makes for cool grooves.*
