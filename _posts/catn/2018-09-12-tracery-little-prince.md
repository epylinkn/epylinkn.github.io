I chose to focus on the The Little Prince. A particular feature of the story that I remember is how during his journey, the little prince goes out to explore other tiny asteroids (worlds) and finds that each are inhabited by a professional adult. In doing so he is exposed to adulthood and he doesn't take well to it.

In the original story, he encounters:
- king
- vain man
- drunkard
- businessman
- lamplighter
- geographer

I thought this might be a fun place to generate some additional storylines.

## Goodnight, sweet prince.
