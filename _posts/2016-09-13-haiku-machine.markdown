My second gift for Burning Man this project, while functional, didn't
see much use on the Playa. Unfortunately, as a first-time burner I
didn't realize the policy against MOOP, and decided not to showcase this
project lest it create too much litter.

Using a repurposed, ancient voltmeter (found secondhand at Urban Ore), I
set out to create a bike-mountable installation that generated and printed personalized Haikus. (Personalized in the sense that I wanted participants to hold two wires to complete the circuit and from the resistance measured seed a random haiku generator.
