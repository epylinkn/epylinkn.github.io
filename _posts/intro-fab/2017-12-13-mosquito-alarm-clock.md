## Long Introduction

For a while, I was thinking about what I could build that I had already built so I could finish this homework without needing a late night and squeeze in some extra sleep time.

But in true finals spirit and to make things as challenging as possible. Even better, I decided to start this project the night before it was due.

Lately, my thoughts have all been revolving around sleep. As I push myself to stay up late and get things done over finals, I find that I've been missing my morning alarm more.

> Wake up earlier on weekends. Now you get to sleep in for 5 days a week instead of two.

To fix this problem I've been thinking about getting a louder alarm. Or possibly on of those alarms that move and are un-snoozable. But the more I think about it the more I think we see it all wrong. A few nights ago, it occurred to me as I was trying to get an amazing 4 hour sleep night but couldn't because a mosquito had gotten into my room. A thought occurs to me and I check online to see if I can buy mosquitos and I can!

Mosquitoes are the worst, right? Well, what if the alarm clock (it really is a dead man's switch, right?) unleashed something horrific so that you HAD to wake up to prevent it!

### Mosquito Alarm Clock

Simply place a mosquito in the capsule. Press the button to reset your sleep timer. And then wake the fuck up or the mosquito gets loose and you'll have bites on your face.

## Process

In terms of components, I really wanted to do this with a stepper notor rotating a threaded shaft, an LCD screen, and a button to reset the dead man's switch.

*Stepper motor driver breaks... FML*

*And now I have to go at it with raw wires! Luckily, I hate JSTs and I'll probably end up in the hospital removing one someday. So cutting this off felt glorious.*

*In frugal ITP fashion, I thought I could use a bolt and nut as the threaded rod. Well, why not build a custom shaft coupler to mount the bolt to my stepper motor? Ben definitely didn't tell us not to do that.*

*Ah, ahead of schedule. Green tea ice cream sandwich break.*

*Custom shaft coupler looks pretty great glued together!*

*And it turns great too!*

*Here it is!*

*Lasercut a quick cardboard panel to start putting things together spatially.*

*The LCD module is a real pain because it requires 23213,12312,12213129821 OUTPUT pins. =X I finally got it working and I still don't get why we need a potentiometer...*

*Rushing through everything, I decided to use long wires and wire nuts. Because I hate soldering and what could possibly go wrong? Somehow, I already know I'm going to regret the wire mess...*

*Midway progress looking pretty good!*

*And now to figure out how to house our mosquito. Beautiful option A: glass, beautiful, and a ton of work.*

*Realistic option B: plastic, cheap, acorn.*

### FAIL SLOW, LEARN LITTLE

*Morning of, I can't seem to get my stepper to turn anymore... yet it still hums as if to taunt me. The mess of wires comes back to haunt me. I give up and decide to use a servo. To really showcase what I've learned, I decide hot glue will work just fine for this tiny servo.*
