Not sure why but I wasn't super excited for the 4-axis mill. As a machine, what it does can be magical. However, it just felt unapproachably expensive. It's not something you'll find in your standard makerspace. Nor is it something you'd ever buy.

This machine is frustratingly slow?

First, it craps out on soft wood...

Then, they way it contours material could be improved with some lathe-like toolpaths. For example, when it cuts tabs on both sides it hits one point on the left, lifts, hits one point on the right, lifts, rotates slightly, and repeats. Whereas it seems like it would be a lot more efficient (for round stock) to rough in a circular motion to reduce bit travel time...

Also this roundnose drill bit has seen some better days. Definitely get your own if you plan on doing more work with this machine.


If I did this again, I'd print it without tabs... and just bandsaw the motherfucker. Your going to sand the two tabbed sides anyway...
