Project ideas for Intro to Physical Computing. Most explore the concepts around time -- traveling, manipulating, or fretting. =P

### Time Machine

I've been enamored with time travel for a long time -- movies, science fiction books, and really just day dreams in 5th grade math class. In this project, I want to explore the experience of time travel -- that is, the feelings that time travel evokes before and the questions that arise after.

In doing so, I think it's also important to do the interaction right, which is where PCOMP is going to be the most fun.

By the laws of Special Relativity which I'm now a temporary expert in, this Time Machine will actually work!

### Sunrise Dancing Booth

In this second exploration on time, I poke fun at the joke that staring at a clock causes it to not move. This booth is a party booth where the objective is to "party" until sunrise. To actually move the clock towards sunrise, we gear the clock to move faster when one isn't looking! (via face-tracking / computer vision). Using "not-looking-at-the-clock" as a proxy for properly parting.

### Vending Machine for Future Ailments

A familiar vending machine with a p5 interface serving up "imagined" future ailments.

In this third exploration on time, I reach deep into my brain to express some of my future fears. In the familiar form of a vending machine, I'd like to sell prescription kits for ailments that I fear now and into the future.

*Familiar, wall-mounted vending machine. Especially want it to be slim profile.*

A convenient stop to get your new cyberworld cures, 24x7.

Items for purchase include:
- anti-CRISPR vitamins (to ward off gene therapy attacks)
- silent sonic attack detection device (like diabetes blood drop)
- one disposable turing test kit (NOTE: does not work on cyborgs)
  - NOTE: not perfect at detecting all forms of AI
- one course radiation treatment (omeprazole style?)
- VR adblock one-month subscription

### Loneliness wearable (twohandtouch.me)

A wearable that attempts to measure loneliness. This is not easy, and would involve finding a reliable and accurate proxy.

One such proxy is skin hunger, or really, the lack of physical human contact. Perhaps there is a way to measure the change in resistance when two people hold hands?

### Whiskey Sphere
