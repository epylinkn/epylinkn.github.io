I set out to make a geodesic dome with repeatable geodesic dome connectors. Clearly, this isn't a geodesic dome. Manufacturing the connectors proved too difficult. Instead I chose to explore making a spherical ice ball machine to up my whiskey drinking game. These are wood prototypes and lacking in a few features -- e.g. I didn't get a ball plunge bit in time. But they're still useful for a possible physical computing project. Anyway, this all proved to be a great start for a production run with aluminum bar that I'm hoping to make next month for awesome Christmas Gifts.

*The inspiration. You might be this in the wild for a very overpriced $1000.*

### Pancaking, with an eye towards repeatability.

*2x4s from the Grumpy McGrumperson at Metropolitan Lumber. A reminder to learn your materials!*

Lesson 1: WTF? 2x4s are not actually 2x4in, but instead have nominal and actual dimensions. [Useful Jump](http://mistupid.com/homeimpr/lumber.htm)

*What I really wanted was a 4x4 but not sure that exists. Grumpy McGrumperson not helpful. Glued two 2x4s together. Weird clamps for the win. My clamp game is strong.*

*Testing out first try at center-punch and circle-drawing jig. Too big... see 2x4 notes above. =X*

*One measurement. Don't need to be precise here because I'm just going to stop block everything > 1.*

*Stop Block and Mitre On*

*Lasercut center-punch jig with cutouts for tracing circle we'll need later.*

*Center-punching feels so damn good.*

*Prepping the drill press. Two clamps make a HUGE difference in preventing slippage. Use >= 2 clamps!*

*Prepping the top block and larger bottom block. We clamp them together and drill press them together to be double sure that the dowel will fit/align through both blocks.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/32-drill-press.jpg)
*A whole lot of clamps. XY-axis adjusting clamp was a real timesaver in making the three holes in series here.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/35-drill-press.jpg)
*Actually drill-press.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/36-dowel-test-fail.jpg)
*Dowel test fail. It fits but too snug.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/37-dowel-better.jpg)
*Pancake test: Much better dowel movement with next-size-up drill bit.*

*A jig that fits more snugly on the dowel to trace an accurate circle.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/41-rough-cut-wheel.jpg)
*Circle traced. And then roughly cut to remove away as much material as possible.*

*Using circle-sander and a wheel jig to turn our rough cut circles into beautiful, round wheels.*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/43-wheels.jpg)
*A beautiful, round wheel.*

*Dowel test before we start to really repeat everything.*

### Rinse and Repeat!

Everything looks good. Rush to get everything done before the shop closes or someone else needs to move my setup to use the machine...

*Clamp; Center-punch; Drill*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/51-repeating-dowel.jpg)
*Dowel test. Whew, it's looking OK!*

![alt](/assets/img/intro-fab/repeatables/52-repeating-circles.jpg)
*Rough-cut circles, yearning to be smooth wheels.*

*And we're done! Not quite ready for shaping ice blocks, but great for alt framing. Credit to Roland for the Cuneiform Tile.*
