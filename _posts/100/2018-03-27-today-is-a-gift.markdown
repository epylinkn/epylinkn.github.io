I've been thinking a lot lately that I'm not challenging myself enough. And I have a feeling that this status quo won't do if I do want to develop as an artist.

So thinking about the 100 days challenge and what I want most out of it, I think that I want to overcome impostor anxiety. In short, I want to spend 100 days putting my ideas out there. It's an effort to be loud, and and effort to claim my knowledge (learning to understand that you don't have to master something to speak about it).

Essentially, in tune with my larger goal of self-expression, I want to learn to express myself more fully through writing -- striving to be loud and unashamed.

I think too many important voices go unheard. I don't say that in arrogance, but rather it comes from fear. In our lifetime I think we'll see many unique problems that need solving, and I oft find that a less capable person is willing to speak up more loudly than a very capable person. (Think Dunning-Kruger effect.) But beyond that, there's a fear of tackling complex problems when you understand them as complex, which an intellectual does understand. This often causes one to stay silent or abstain from problem.
