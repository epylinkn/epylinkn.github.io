message: "Nice work and documentation.  I've always been an Ice Man fan myself.\r\n\r\nI like the stacked technique to make the handle, but you could have drilled the spade bit hole first, then the hole saw all in the same set up on the drill press.  You would just have to change out bits.  Or you could have used a tube and just capped the ends off.\r\n\r\nI'm a little confused how the locking mechanism works, and would like to get a closer look at that.  Maybe a short video would clear that up in the documentation."
