To be honest, I've been super curious about materials since the semester started. Seeing all the projects people from different backgrounds were building, I noticed they all had a standard and aesthetic. I had none and it was time to find it.

On this materials journey, I took my first ever mold-making class last week at The Compleat Sculptor. In 2 tumultuous hours, I learned so much information that I remembered none of it. =P However, I walked away with some alginate, silicone, and quikrete. Time to explore!

### Quikrete (Concrete)

Overall, I found concrete really enjoyable to work with. Cheap, sturdy, and easy. The only real negatives: it's heavy and the dust gets everywhere.

*According to Sarah, this is the only concrete that'll matter to me.*

*Mold release is a thing! (Because you have to remove it, dummy.) Somehow the internet pointed me to the magic of PAM. Perfect, because they have it at the deli and I might want to bake later...*

*Measure once, pour twice. JK but I used Jen's fancy coffee scale and measured out half the bag.*

*Add 8-ounces water. I'm actually amazed how low ratio of water concrete requires. (And how difficult it is to stir.)*

*I'm in need of an ashtray, so I 3D printed an ashtray negative. Kinda wasteful, but it also let me explore NinjaTek, some flexible 3D filament that I just came across recently and thought would make a great flexible mold.*

*Put the concrete in the thingy.*

*Also, make a tall candle holder using a box and pushing the candle in.*

*And next, a tealight candle holder using an egg carton top.*

*Throw in some spice jars that just so happens to match the dimensions of tealights and hope for the best.*

### Silicone

Silicone is expensive but I already love it. It came in a simple 1:1 A/B mixture, has a 15 minute pot time and 40 minute set time, both majorly convenient. It also has the awesome (unless you're trying to glue it to something which the internet says is a bit of a specialty) property of not adhering to many things. For the most part, silicone best adheres to silicone. Using this fact, I cast the silicone sheet I needed straight into my tray without mold release. *fingers_crossed*

It's also friendly in that I don't see much caution around toxicity or careful usage. Safe is always good, right?

And oh is it clean! No dust, no spills, no messes.

*SmoothOn "Dragon Skin". I'm actually exploring silicone for a "sticky" hand interface I'm trying to build and Sarah at Compleat Sculptor pointed me to Dragon Skin for its great elasticity.*

*I really just need a thin sheet of silicone for my interface. So we use a box that's bigger than my hand.*

*Mix A. Mix B. Mix A into B. It starts to have the consistency of liquid sugar or something between honey and maple syrup. *

*Awesome because it pours right out and levels itself once in the tray. NOTE: I removed the plastic cover from the mold because we don't need it to release the silicone!*

*40 minutes. OMG.*

### Liquid Latex

*Found some liquid latex my roommate had lying around from halloween.*

*Casting it into a circular mold. Thinking it can be an excellent round seat for my ashtray.*

### All the Things

TODO update in the morning when things set.

In the end, I don't think I actually completed the assignment fully. However, for now I'm quite satisfied that I was able to explore with new materials.
