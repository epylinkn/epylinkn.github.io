<h1>About</h1>

<ul class="post-list">
  Life behaves like a shoreline with its inevitable ebb and flow.
  One moment you see everything clearly and the next moment the walls feel as if they've been there all along.
  Funny how in low times, you still have some sense of the happier times on there way or there not too long ago.
  It's a testament to the cyclical behavior of lifeâ€™s unfolding.

  I'm a developer &amp; artist living in Brooklyn. Here is where I express myself. I made it for you.
