I left class last week thinking a lot about dialog trees and how they're pervasive in video games. And even more troubling, how I played a lot of video games  growing up and how I've been raised by those video games.

In earnest, I set out to try and create a game with a more realistic representation of human interactions. But alas, that's incredibly hard. As it goes, any rules of interaction immediately miss the point. Codifying human interactions _is_ the problem.

Anyway, in an attempt to learn what I want by actually creating what I don't want, I decided to create a simple dialog tree RenPy that illustrates how to properly commiserate with someone. This proved to be a fascinating exercise and I learned a lot about my own biases. I'm an engineer at heart, and I've always been told that I try to problem solve too much, when a lot of times people just want to vent. Commiseration Trainer in a nutshell... is just that!
