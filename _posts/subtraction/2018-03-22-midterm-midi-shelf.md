Initially for the midterm, I really wanted to build something big. I was torn between too ideas but ended up choosing the wall shelf idea because it is more useful in my apartment.

## Initial Concept

## Figuring out the pulley mechanics

## Making a mini

### First Assembly... RUH ROH

### CNC Imperfections

### Second Assembly... CLOSE...

## Let's do it!
Or not... CNC time is a precious commodity these past few days. On top of that, winter storms can be really stressful for the last minute folks like myself. T.T

To be continued...

## What's Next

To me, this project has a bit further to go. However, though I can see all the tiny flaws myself (craftman's curse?), I want to do a better job decided which flaws matter to a user and which don't. CNC can take whole lot of repetition... and I can see myself printing this quite a few times.
