For our Unity exercise I wanted to build a game I've been thinking about
for a couple weeks. Here, I host the work in progress.

Called Fence, the basic idea is it resembles a simple pong /
arkanoid-like paddle game in the beginning. The player slowly learns
that "fencing" colored runners gains points and "fencing" white runners
lowers points.

As the player progresses in the game the camera begins to zoom in and
details begin to emerge. Slowly the paddle becomes a fence, symbolic of
a border. And the runners become representative of different races.

Another option is to zoom out as the game progresses, revealing the
outlines of a continent, as a way of suggesting this game is about
protecting borders.

I'm still figuring out how to show the effects of being too good at
keeping colored runners out contributes to a non-ideal outcome.
