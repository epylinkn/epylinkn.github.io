message: "Nice work.  The lighting effect is good and I'm surprised it works so well on bent acrylic.  I haven't experimented with that, but I assumed it wouldn't work as well as flat pieces.\r\n\r\nNext steps for this project: you should consider a reliable way to mount the LEDs to the leaves and a way to mount the leaves to the case.  The way you have it now is fine for prototyping, but I think a more robust design will be required in the future."
