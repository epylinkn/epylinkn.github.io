### Tips for Future Anthony

Regarding interviews:
- Use a lens hand wave when there are segments you definitely want to
use
- Get two camera angles! They'll help with awkward jumpcuts whe you need
them


Video tips:
- Ken Burns - pan and zoom stills so they are useful!
- Try your best to do video only / stills only
- Collect video / stills on separate days!
- Get variations of shots you know you'll need
  - wide
  - medium
  - detail
  - portrait
  - macro
