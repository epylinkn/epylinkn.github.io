## Pendulum Switch

I wanted to make a switch with a lot of dynamic motion. At the time, there was a steel ruler on my desk, which also happened to have a notch on one end. Using that ruler, some twine and weight I tried to make a pendulum that turns the switch on and off.

I used the steel ruler as a conductive surface, while the swinging pendulum would periodically push the steel ruler to complete the circuit.

*Simple circuit: The only component is an LED that lights up when the ruler completes the circuit.*

*Simple circuit: From below, we see an incomplete circuit with a breakage point where the conductive ruler can complete it.*

Honestly, this didn't work as well as I had hoped. It worked for a bit but copper tape isn't great at maintaining continuity so the LED lighting was very spotty. I was hoping for more periodicity and if I wanted to improve it I'd use a fulcrum and counterweight for a bit more seesaw action.

## Plinko Switches

This didn't get anywhere near finished, as the wiring was a little hard to figure out and near-impossible to do with copper tape. This might get revitalized on a large scale at some point. =P

The idea was that as the plink disc drops, it completes a circuit with each pin it hits, thereby lighting up the LED above that column. I wanted to achieve it purely mechanically, but found it hard to prototype several incomplete parallel circuits with copper tape.
